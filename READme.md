# Theoretical constraints on beyond Standard Model extensions of the Higgs potential

Complutense University of Madrid, Faculty of Physics, Theoretical Physics Department.

**Master's Thesis title**: Theoretical constraints on beyond Standard Model extensions of the Higgs potential.

**Author**: Javier Eloy de la Peña Vico.

**Tutors**: Juan José Sanz Cillero and Carlos Ariel Quezada Calonge.

## **IMPORTANT**
This code shall be understood as an attached file to the Master's Thesis mentioned hererinabove. It should never be treated "AS IS".

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jdlpv/Theoretical-constraints-on-beyond-Standard-Model-extensions-of-the-Higgs-potential
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Theoretical-constraints-on-beyond-Standard-Model-extensions-of-the-Higgs-potential
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install Jupyter and dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Additional steps (when using Jupyter Notebook IDE)

6. Add the virtual environment to Jupyter:
   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv --display-name "Jupyter (venv)"
   ```

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then, in Jupyter:
   - Open a new notebook.
   - Go to **Kernel > Change Kernel**.
   - Select **"Jupyter (venv)"**.
